# 🖨️ Voron 2.4 – Klipper Configuration (Stealthburner)

This repository contains my personal **Klipper configuration** for my **Formbot Voron 2.4** running a **Stealthburner** toolhead.  
The structure mirrors my printer’s `printer_data/config` directory and is automatically backed up to GitHub whenever changes are made on the printer.

## 🔄 Automatic Backups

This repository is automatically kept in sync from the printer:

- Changes inside `printer_data/config` are auto-committed and pushed to GitHub  
- Commit messages indicate whether files were ➕ added, ✏️ updated, or 🗑️ removed  
- Provides a full change history of tuning, hardware changes, and macro edits  

This makes it easy to roll back changes or recover configs after a crash or SD card failure.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These configurations are **hardware-specific** and tuned for my machine.  
If you use anything from this repo as reference:

- Double-check pin assignments  
- Verify thermistors, heaters, and safety limits  
- Review stepper directions and endstops  
- Do **not** blindly copy PID values or probe offsets  

Use as reference, not as plug-and-play.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

- Automatic backups of Klipper configs  
- Track configuration changes over time  
- Easy recovery after failures or upgrades  
- Share macros and configuration patterns  

## 🗺️ Future Organization (Planned)

Over time, this repo may be further organized into folders like:

hardware/
calibration/
ui/


For now, only `macros/` is grouped to keep changes low-risk while the setup evolves.
